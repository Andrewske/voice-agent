# Notes

General notes and information for voice assistant context.

## 2026-01-10

### Priorities
- N8N setup with Kristen - need to figure out her next priorities since messaging didn't work

### Voice Agent TODO
- Investigate: What happens if I send a new audio message before getting a response? Is there a queue or will it fail? Live test this.


### Home Automation Ideas
- Better Google Home commands for room lights
- "Chill" command - all lights at 5%
- "Brake" command - slightly brighter default mode
- Wake-up sequence: music gets louder + gradual lights, say "I'm awake" to turn down
- Need automation tied to actual alarm time (not fixed schedule)
- Air freshener scheduling (not 24/7)
- Humidifier better scheduling
- Consider dedicated USB keypad for room controls
- Could connect voice agent to home automation for watch-based voice commands
