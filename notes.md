**Personal Story Agent / Knowledge Base Builder**

Context: Trying m0 which does what I was building before. Want to build personal history/knowledge base.

**Core insight:** Maximum context from minimum questions, but can't feel like filling out a form or interview.

**Key design principles:**
- Questions should open people up, not be yes/no
- Should feel like dialogue, not interview
- Needs back-and-forth: giving ideas, validating, empathizing as situation calls
- Empathy has to feel real (tough challenge)
- Could analyze how I communicate to ask better questions
- Maybe personality evolves over time based on how I want to interact

**What to avoid:**
- Cheerleading
- Form-filling vibes
- Interview format
- Forced personality tests (Myers-Briggs style felt wrong)
- Surface-level questions like "favorite Harry Potter character"

**What might work:**
- Fun personality test *vibes* but deeper
- Questions that naturally bring out stories with rich context
- Genuine curiosity that makes sharing feel worthwhile
- Dialogue where both sides contribute

**"Recreate Me" Idea - AI Twin for Claude Code Planning**

Could train/fine-tune a model on my side of Claude Code conversations to create an "AI Kevin" that plans ideas the way I do. Have all my responses + agent outputs as training data. Constraints like message/token limits could shape it. Fun project, not high priority but genuinely interesting.
